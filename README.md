# Scratch Paper With RandomuserAPI And Style

In this project, random users fetched from
[RandomUser](https://www.randomuser.me) and random jobs were fetched from [DataAtWork.org](https://www.dataatwork.org) website.

##### You can edit the 'UserContext.js' file to modify the queries.

Since the dataatwork website does not have an SSL certificate, there are no jobs in deploy. but if you use localhost it will be fixed.
